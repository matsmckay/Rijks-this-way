            <p>I am a software developer with experience building and testing software systems. I have a proven ability to deliver high quality software solutions to a variety of business and technical needs and a proven track record of cultivating strong relationships with all team members and customers alike. I understand that success is about delivering timely solutions to customers that are high quality, both external (what the customer sees) and internal (what the developer sees and maintains). I value building a partnership with the customers and working closely with them to understand their needs so that we solve the right problem the right way. I seek to understand the full depth and multi-dimensional aspects of problems. I enjoy complex assignments that tax my intellect, talents and skills to the limit. I have an excellent ability to break ideas down systematically. I am devoted to rationality, logic and rigorous analysis and apply it to nearly all problems I encounter. I relish opportunities to influence others, inspire enthusiasm, improve morale and hold others capable.</p>
